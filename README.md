## Installation and Setup

Clone down this repository. You will need `node` and `npm` installed globally on your machine.

### Automation Script:

Simply run the (Star Wars themed!) script located at the root of the file and answer a few questions to automatically install dependencies, create environment variables, and start the development server for the first time. I tried to automate the process as much as possble!

#### Change current directory

`cd <path/to/cloned/project>`

#### Run the script

`sh musician_match.sh`

Answer a few questions, and watch the project boot up in front of you!

## Description

Whether you're looking for a new bandmate, lesson teacher, professional for hire, or just someone to jam with, Musician Match is here to help. Simply input your location, what type of musician you're seeking, what instruments you play, and a short bio. You may optionally enter links to your website or music as well.

You may then search our directory for your nearest match! Once you're ready, just shoot them an email. It's that simple! In the future I plan on adding more features such as direct messaging, automatic display of top matches, and a swiping feature similar to Tinder.

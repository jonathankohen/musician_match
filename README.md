## Description

Whether you're looking for a new bandmate, lesson teacher, professional for hire, or just someone to jam with, Musician Match is here to help. Simply input your location, what type of musician you're seeking, what instruments you play, and a short bio. You may optionally enter links to your website or music as well.

You may then search our directory for your nearest match! Once you're ready, just shoot them an email. It's that simple! In the future I plan on adding more features such as direct messaging, automatic display of top matches, and a swiping feature similar to Tinder.
